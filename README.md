1. Give me an example of the project or initiative that you started on your own. It can be a non-business one. What prompted you to get started?
Cause:
Recognized the need for a personalized fitness solution to streamline gym routines and help individuals achieve their fitness goals more effectively.

Action:
Developed the "Gymness" Fullstack Web App over 100 hours, focusing on creating personalized fitness programs tailored to individual goals, such as weight loss and overall fitness. Implemented features to allow users to access programs for different fitness levels and track their progress towards their desired body.

Result:
As a result of this initiative, "Gymness" provided users with a comprehensive platform to improve their fitness journey. It successfully streamlined gym routines, empowered users to achieve their fitness goals, and demonstrated my ability to develop innovative solutions in the field


2. Tell me about a time you had to work on several projects at once. How did you handle this?
Cause:
At one point in my career, I found myself working on multiple projects simultaneously due to the high demand for my skills and expertise in web development. (Can bring the fact that this was during my time freelancing)

Action:
To effectively manage this situation, I implemented a strategic approach to prioritize tasks and allocate time efficiently. I utilized project management techniques such as creating detailed schedules, setting clear deadlines for each project, and breaking down tasks into manageable chunks. Additionally, I maintained open communication channels with clients and team members to ensure everyone was informed of project statuses and timelines.

Result:
By implementing these strategies, I successfully juggled multiple projects at once without compromising on quality or deadlines. I was able to deliver exceptional results for each project while maintaining a high level of productivity and professionalism. This experience strengthened my project management skills and demonstrated my ability to thrive in fast-paced environments, ultimately contributing to my growth as a software engineer.


3. Describe a situation in which you felt you had not communicated well enough. What did you do? How did you handle it?
**Cause:**
During a web development project for a client, I realized there was a misalignment in understanding their core requirements for a new feature. Initially, we were building a dashboard they hadnâ€™t fully approved, and their feedback indicated that their needs had shifted since our initial conversation.

**Action:**
I immediately scheduled a dedicated meeting with the client to address the issue. In this meeting, I actively listened to their concerns, asking open-ended questions such as, "Can you walk me through how you'd like this dashboard to function in your daily operations?" This helped them clarify their expectations. I also presented mock-ups of the current version and alternative layouts based on their comments, using visual aids to ensure our understanding was aligned. Throughout the meeting, I took detailed notes to document any changes or new requests.

**Result:**
As a result, we revised the project plan to better match the client's needs, adjusting timelines and feature priorities accordingly. This change reduced further miscommunication and allowed the team to complete the project on time and within scope. Additionally, the client appreciated the effort to realign our goals and extended our contract for additional work, strengthening our partnership.
